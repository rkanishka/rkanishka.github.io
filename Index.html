            <h2>About Me</h2>
          
            <p>Hi, my name is kanishka . I'm a passionate aspiring software developer who recently completed intensive full stack development and Python courses through a bootcamp. While I'm new to the professional world, I've gained hands-on experience with modern web technologies and programming languages during my training.My bootcamp experience has equipped me with skills in both front-end and back-end development, including technologies JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python. I've worked on several projects that have sharpened my problem-solving abilities and taught me how to collaborate effectively in a development environment.I'm now eager to apply my skills and continue learning in a professional setting. I'm actively seeking opportunities as a junior software developer where I can contribute to meaningful projects and grow alongside experienced professionals.
